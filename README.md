<h1>introduction</h1>



We are the Bakers Team, and we would like to introduce you to our autonomous car, Cookie!
Cookie is more than just a project â€“ itâ€™s a combination of innovation, teamwork, and problem-solving. Designed for the WRO Future Engineers category, Cookie is equipped with smart sensors, precise control systems, and advanced programming that allow it to navigate, adapt, and make decisions on its own.

Our goal with Cookie is not only to compete but also to explore real-world applications of autonomous technology. From improving road safety to reducing human error, autonomous cars represent the future of mobility â€“ and Cookie is our step toward that future.

Through this project, weâ€™ve learned to collaborate, test ideas, and overcome challenges together. Every component, from the hardware to the software, was built and fine-tuned by our team to ensure Cookie can handle dynamic environments while staying efficient and reliable.

Weâ€™re excited to share our journey with you, and we hope Cookie inspires others to keep building, innovating, and dreaming big.
